## Build & Run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

- install dependencies:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

- run in dev mode:

  ```shell
  npm run start
  ```

P.S. I personally recommend `cnpm` instead of `npm` **in China** .
